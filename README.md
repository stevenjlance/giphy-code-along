**GOAL:** The goal today is to code out a gif-finder that takes in a user's keyword and sends you back the gifs that meet that criteria.

## WARM UP!

The page has a button on it already. Code out an event listener in the script.js file that logs "button pressed!" to the console when the button is pressed, and confirm that it is working.

## API INSTRUCTIONS  
1. Go to [https://developers.giphy.com/](https://developers.giphy.com/).
2. Log in or create a developer account.
3. Click "create an app". Give it whatever name ("test") and description ("testing the API") you like.
4. Copy your API key to the clipboard.
5. If you think you know what comes next, open up script.js and code out what's missing.
6. To get the web address for the API call, go to [https://developers.giphy.com/explorer](https://developers.giphy.com/explorer). This will generate a URL with your API key and with a general search (see gif below). You can also preview the JSON object that will be rendered if you code out the request properly!

7. Follow the remaining instructions that are comments in the `script.js` file.
